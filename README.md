Upload the theme to your WordPress directory in wp-content/themes/

## Credits

The Material Design WordPress Theme was started in 2014 by [Brad Williams](http://twitter.com/braginteractive/).

## Contributors

Without the following projects/people this theme wouldn't be possible:

- http://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/
- http://underscores.me/
- http://getbootstrap.com

## Customization
Basic colors changes can be made in the WordPress Customizer ( Appearance -> Customize -> Colors).

If you need to further customize the theme, it is recommended that you first create a child theme so you will be able to update the theme in the future. You can read how to create a WordPress Child theme [here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes).
